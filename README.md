# landing-page

Make sure to update the following parameters to personalize your project:

- **index.html.** Adjust, if necessary, your ```<meta>``` of your favicon code (colors, etc.), site title, logo, roles, intro description of what you do, contact information and fill the fields for your *.vcf*-file.
- **Logo.** Add your logo in SVG format in all 3 .html-files at the top and update the ```viewBox``` attribute to enable resizing the SVG. Use [SVGOMG](https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/) for optimization of the file.
- **Privacy + Imprint.** Update responsible person, their address, your VAT number, your hoster and the desired form of salutation throughout the text within the docs privacy and imprint. *Please note: currently, these docs are only available in German since it's legally mandatory to have these. If there is demand to translate it to English, I will do so.*
- **Favicon.** Create one and optimize your favicon via [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and extract the contents of the folder into the */favicon* folder.
